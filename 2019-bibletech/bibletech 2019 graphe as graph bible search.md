# Graphé as Graph

Mobile search is fastest-growing method of engagement w/ scripture.

## Strings vs. Things

Searching Abraham vs. Abram. “Abraham” first result is Gen 17.5: “No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham.”

Searching Saul: mixed results between Israelite king and converted Pharisee (aka Paul).

Gilead: mixed results about a land area and a person. 

Project: Theographic (logo has o/g presented as a chain)

Graph: writing. 

- Written or printed representation of a basic unit of speech. Typography.
- A single occurrence of a letter of an alphabet in any of its various shapes. Glyph or Grapheme.
- A diagram that represents the variation of a variable in comparison w/ that of one or more other variables. Infographics.
- A collection of vertices and edges that join pairs of vertices or nodes.
- In mathematics, a set of objects or nodes in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense related.

Graphs are intimately related to search, relating inputs to people, places, passages, and more.

Mobile search is particularly bad about not accepting misspellings.

## Example of Bible w/ hyperlinks

In passage, each name, place, etc. is hyperlinked to information about that entity.


## Challenges 

- Data availability and openness: very little data is openly available. Tyndale House in Cambridge and YWAM are beginning to share their work openly.
- Lack of word-level detail for many translations
- Institutional priority alignments

## What happens next?

- Follow successful models: Pelagios Linked Pasts focused on developing historical metadata in an open fashion. He’s linking their data to Stephen’s place data.
- Partnerships on projects w/ similar vision
- Connecting with others
