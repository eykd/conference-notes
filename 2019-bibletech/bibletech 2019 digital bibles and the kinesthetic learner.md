# Digital Bibles and the Kinesthetic Learner

Joe Carter, background in QA, customer service, and UI/UX

Kinesthetic learning is about physical experiences using the whole body, rather than listening or watching.

A subset: hands-on, touch, or tactile learning, where you learn about something by touch, and you can intuit place in a resource by touch and weight.

Skeumorphic: where a software object mimics a real-world counterpart.

## It’s all technology

Bible “technology” is just the latest iteration in a long line of technological innovations.

Video: experience the power of the bookbook.

Our modern print Bible is packed with technology developed over 2,000 years.

## Advantages to print bibles and books

- Permanence
  - Durability (you can buy Bibles from 1611 today)
  - What’s on the page stays on the page. It can’t be changed.
- No future file compatibility or licensing issues
- How long is this book?
- How far are you through this book?
- Distraction free
- Doesn’t need batteries
- Context *can* be easier to see
- Pages don’t reflow—text is in the same place every time.
- Can’t hide the fact that you’re reading a Bible.
  - At least w/ more traditionally bound Bibles.
- Inherent physicality and reality to it.
- The screen you hold in your hand can become other things: a movie, a game, a phone call. The Bible is only a Bible. First Things: the tool is not benign.
- A Bible is inherently devoted for Holy use.

## Disadvantages

- Many of the advantages are a double-edged sword.
- Text not adaptive: a large-print is a new Bible.
- Notes and annotations are stuck in one place.
- No updates or corrections to printing errors.
- Only one resource at a time.
- Can’t localize to different languages.
- Large resources can be *very* burdensome, if not impossible to travel with.
- Missionaries have to take bags of books w/ them.
- Large resource sets can be prohibitively expensive—public domain resources can’t be offered for free like often is the case in digital.

## Advantages to Digital Bibles

- Many of these are double-edged
- Carry an entire library in your pocket
- The best bible is the one you have w/ you
- You can sneak resources into places where they’re forbidden
- Your study Bible can be distraction-free if you need it (at least in layout)
- Files stored in the cloud and can be moved to new devices as tech changes

## Is a magazine just a broken iPad?

- popular video w/ 1yo trying to use magazine like iPad
- No, but customers expect us to be digitally savvy

Is skeuomorphic design the answer? (No, not really… it’s a start though… it’s really about affordances.)

## The big issues

- You can’t touch it.
- How can we communicate intuitive “whereness” of scripture
- Reading and retention of print vs. digital

How to make our interfaces less distracting w/o locking down the customer?
