# Designing for Agency in Bible Study

Stephen Smith

Bible software supports only a small subset of the Christian life as lived, but can support more if we consider agency during the design process.


## Overview

What is Agency?

Player Experience of Need Satisfaction model

The Christian life as lived

A practical Franken-Bible application that tries to apply this model:  expandedbible.com


“For the Life of the World” Miroslav Volf. Does theology support the vision of a flourishing life?

Weird spiral diagram: love, peace, joy.

Agency is the ability to act; making meaningful choices. Life as a video game.

Software is interactive. Video games are interactive.

Agency: Exercising choices that lead to a flourishing life.

Agency != Engagement

Success often measured as engagement, but this focus ignores actual needs of people.

Religious orientations in sociology:

- Intrinsic: religion as an end
- Extrinsic: religion as a means
- Quest: religion as search for truth

Extrinsic Christianity is like an “idle game”—a game the plays itself. 

Sociology -> Psychology, Self-Determination Theory

People have 3 needs:

- Competence
- Relatedness
- Autonomy

Player Experience of Need Satisfaction (PENS) Theory based on Self-Determination Theory. Model from 2007, reasonably successful in making better games.

## Competence

- Feeling of mastery and progress
- Optimal challenge; “flow” state (not too hard, not too easy)
- Sense of power; mastery in action

This is right with how Bible software presents itself in marketing!

Extrinsic rewards undermine intrinsic feelings of competence/mastery.

Naive gamification converts intrinsic feeling of competence to an extrinsic one.

Games have rewards. Some are intrinsic, affecting play. Some are extrinsic.

Intrinsic:
- Access (unlocks)
- facility (increased effectiveness)
- Sustenance (reduce negative play state)

Extrinsic:
- Glory (quantifiable; badges)
- Praise: “Great job!”
- Sensory feedback (fireworks; spectacle)

## Relatedness

Desire to connect w/ others.

In multiplayer, in single player, can be with real people, or w/ NPCs (Eliza effect)

In Bible software:

- Forums (quality score: time to first KJV-only post)
- Social sharing (YouVersion reported over one million shares/day in 2018)
- In YouVersion, share activity w/ friends; directly communicate; limited to 150 friends (Dunbar’s number!)

Facilitating deeper relationships? Is it possible? A good idea?

- Proximity
- Similarity
- Reciprocity (escalating series of interactions)
- Disclosure (safe, consensual, intimate sharing)

Bible software as NPC. Chatbots? Voice? AI?

## Autonomy

Not just freedom to do whatever you want (paradox of choice)

Difficult interfaces detract from autonomy.

Autonomy as volition: wanting to do things that you are doing. Willingly giving up freedom in exchange for other goals, such as enjoyment.

- Logos workflows (making framework for doing important things)
- YouVersion reading plans

Reading Plans are the 21st century 1800s Gospel tracts.

- Short form
- Produced by variety of orgs
- Promote the sponsoring org’s brand
- Almost entirely devotional, occasionally evangelistic.

## 20019 Bible software marketing

- Mostly Competence
- Relatedness (Faithlife, separate from core Logos)
- Autonomy (somewhat)

Current focus is on mostly male Christians in leadership roles.

## What answers people are looking for from the Bible?

See handout.

People don’t want systematic theology.

People want help w/ human relatedness. 80% of topics.

## expandedbible.com

Taking a cue from digital fiction: makes you choose the translation as you go.

“Lectio machina”

Demonstrates competence (building skill in understanding the text), relatedness (sharing socially, as a small group).

Autonomy: freedom to express yourself within constraints. Even enjoyable.

Reward for finishing chapter: custom audio recording of your translation via speech synthesis.

## Designing for agency

- Consider features in light of competence, relatedness, and autonomy
- Learn and design for what users need and are already doing, so as not
