# Better Together: Integrating Print & Digital for the Bible

Keith Williams—Senior Ed. @ Tyndale
Dan Farrell—Senior Art Dir. @ Tyndale

- 92% of Bible readers engage digitally
- 91% *prefer* to read in print!

Dan: Strong demand for added “stuff”—competing design constraints. Ex: Illustrated SB, w/ Bible text, illustration, notes, xrefs. Lots of design anti-patterns: small type, two columns, super-thin paper w/ ghosting/show-thru resulting in muddy presentation. *Still* a huge, hard-to-carry, at-home Bible.

Keith: why? What’s the theoretical underpinning of the Filament.

“Reader, Come Home: The Reading Brain in a Digital World” by Maryanne Wolf. Prof. @ Tufts University, Cognitive Neuroscience. What happens in the brain as we read and as we learn to read?

Deep Reading vs. Continuous Partial Attention. Different brain engagement reading language vs. oral language. Oral is hard-wired. Reading is learned, always in flux due to neural plasticity.

What happens as we read changes how we read.

Reading on screens has changed the nature of reading. Skimming is the new normal in digital reading. Continuous partial attention: constant switching of reading sources.

We’re training our brains to read through continuous partial attention, *instead* of deep reading.

Eye movement in digital reading involves skimming movements.

*Making assumptions* and drawing conclusions so we can move on.

Reading difficult texts takes discipline. This discipline can be lost, and must be regained.

Why print is best for deep reading.

Sections are easily perceived; planning can happen: “I can read the next 27 pages in the time I have available.”

Deep reading requires assembling context. Ex: reading and understand the book of Job.

Requires cognitive patience for long-form content. Empathy, background knowledge, analogy and inference, critical analysis, all resulting in insight.

Digital context-switching reading works agains this.

Deep reading of the Bible is vitally important in attending to God’s word. The technology of the print codex is well-suited to this.

He’s not saying that digital reading is bad.

Digital reading is ideal for quick reading and reference: news, encyclopedias, maps. Wikipedia trumps Britannica.

Digital is ideal for meaningful contextual content based on metadata. All the “stuff” surrounding the text in a Study Bible.

Digital is ideal for multimedia and interactive capabilities.

Digital is ideal for its unlimited word count w/o the form factor concerns of print.

## The advantages of combining print & digital

- Permanence of print codex encourages deep reading.
- Provides users w/ multiple windows to engage w/ scripture in a unified experience.
- Print is permanent and sacred. Digital is always changing and updating as new content and scholarship becomes available.

Filament has been out for several months. How people have responded:

- generally positive
- creative, social uses have resulted.
- where’s the Bible in the app? There’s a page number instead(!)
- people who have been trained to read on their phone have felt like they’re missing something; this has been a bridge back to the print.

Print was designed for the reading experience, note-taking (wide-margins)
