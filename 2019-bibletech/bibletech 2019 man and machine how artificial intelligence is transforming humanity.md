# Man & Machine: How AI is transforming Humanity

Jason Thacker

Approaching the topic as an ethicist and theologian.

A lot of hype: the killer robots are coming!

Ads as AI.

AI/Robots theme in Super Bowl commercials.

Fear growing: fear of losing jobs, being outsmarted, being outperformed by the machine. (As old as John Henry!)

Apathy towards AI: hype seems overblown, much of AI is hidden, obvious examples are silly/ridiculous (Siri, Google Assistant, etc.)

Example of accidentally sending text to president of org via Siri in common conversation.

But AI is more present than we realize, in hidden applications.

What are ethical boundaries when applying these technologies in society?

EU just released ethical guidelines. Contrast China, Libya, Egypt embracing AI for authoritarian control.

How to engage these ethical problem as Christians?

It’s a great threat *and* a great opportunity.

## Deeper question: what does it mean to be human?

Genesis 1 & 2: God chose to create everything. 6th day, created Man, named it Very Good, distinct from everything else in Creation, created in his image, given dominion, set as stewards over creation. Given specific jobs. Be fruitful & multiply, exercise dominion and stewardship, etc.

Then the Fall: the natural order of things became broken and undone due to the curse. The earth, our very tools rebel against us.

The good news: the image of God was not lost. The mandate was not retracted.

The purpose of technology is skewed by sin, contorted by sinfulness. But our technology is still a tool to serve God. We fall short of God’s purpose, but our tools are still tools.

The tech we grow up with seems natural; new tech is weird.

Printing press developed in 1450.

To guide our engagement w/ technology we need something larger and more stable than society. Mt. 22:27-39: the entire law and all of scripture can be summed up in loving God and neighbor.

Current tech on cusp of era-defining revolution, but misguided by misperceptions and lies about human place in creation.

Prevalent stream of thought in AI communities: materialistic, utilitarian worldview, human as organic algorithm, not special, product of evolution, to be supplanted by something better and more advanced. The Master Algorithm will supersede us, and humanity will become second rate and die off. Humans as zoo animals for robots.

## Why is AI a human dignity issue?

The true problem is believing the lie that humans are just machines rather than the crowning jewel of creation, that worth and dignity are tied to economic utility rather than bestowed by creator God.

AI can perpetuate this lie, but *it doesn’t have to.*

AI can function *like us*, in ways that tech hasn’t before, that could devalue our perceived worth because they are quicker and more efficient, “better”.

Through the lens of Scripture, we see something different. We are more than our work. We have infinite worth and value as image-bearers of God, and God himself found us so valuable to go through w/ the Incarnation.

Story from Exodus, w/ Israelites sitting at the base of Mt. Sinai while Moses meets w/ God. The people go to Aaron, give their God-given riches, and make the golden calf, and the people worship it. Then Moses comes down and confronts them. Aaron has lame excuse about the calf just appearing. The people didn’t care what the idol said about themselves or about God. The act of fashioning was not sinful: a craftsman is later commended for his skill. The heart was the problem.

We can be tempted similarly, to worship the created and its benefits rather than the creator.

New tech is exciting, but we should be careful about unintended consequences. Ex: facial recognition being abused in China.

The end of the world won’t be AI apocalypse. It will be the people of God standing before the throne and worshiping God.

As believers we should be active in the cultural conversation and allow our moral imaginations room.

Google Duplex: AI agent for making calls and scheduling. Initially didn’t identify itself. So long as the tool identifies itself as such, instead of trying to pass as a human.

Harari: “The God Man” book. Why do we put faces on robots? We want to be like God, and ascribe humanity to technology.

“in Our Own Image”—book by George Zardakis.History of AI, including philosophical and literary history. “As we like God create things in our image, we don’t want to give it free will, because we know how that story ends.”
