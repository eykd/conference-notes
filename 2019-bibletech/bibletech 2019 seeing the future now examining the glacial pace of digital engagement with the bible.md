## Church Online & VR Church

liquidchurch.com — five services/week

What is community? How do you do sacraments? Do we need physicality? [Yes!]

“VR Church is something real.”

## Data / Technologists

Why is this important?

4 paradigm shifts of communication that we need to adapt to for growth.

[Growth of what?]

Technology is about more than skin-deep solutions.

Culture produces and is produced by people relating to media.

## First shift: Time-shifting. Netflix on demand.

How has this affected the church? Sunday is no longer the one day set aside. Everything else in life is on-demand.

## Place shifting: sling box, Youtube TV

The church has responded w/ on-demand content. Podcasts, church apps. 

## Nichification

Cable TV, radio, 1000 channels, etc. etc. (And still nothing on.)

Content available anywhere and everywhere. 

This is the time for the return and the rise of the DJ: the curator.

## Shared experiences

Reality TV, etc. (This is old though: broadcast model, community productions.)

Church response: everybody broadcasting livestream. Copy/paste the live church to the livestream.

VR Church is one attempt at improving on the simple livestream.

We’re in the inflection point as culture changes at a high velocity.

Americans no longer sit around and watch Dan Rather report the news any more. Nobody is watching the same thing at the same time any more.

New reality: media as ME-dia.

Valuation of Netflix has surpassed Disney.

“Everything has changed.“ [But has it? People are still people. Always have been.]

## “Sunday is no longer the hub of the week that we can rely on for the church.”

Attendance is down. [But is he mis-identifying the problem?]

Biblical literacy is way down.

“Priesthood has been liquidated.” The logical conclusion of the Reformation. The role of the pastor has been obliterated. Pastoring happens at the level of small group leader. Democratization of access to scripture, to God.

Content needs have shifted from static to dynamic (Wikipedia > Brittannica)

“The Bible isn’t what culture wants.”

“Divinity Experienced > Jesus Learned”

Encountering Christ is better than learned doctrine and catechisms.

## Factors to accommodate

Multi-everything

Geo/Device/Time-independent

Content has transcended the container.

## What’s next?

- Gutenberg -> Google
- Pages -> Pixel
- Analog -> Digital

None of it is enough. We need technology and culture innovators.

## Q&A

He wants more solutions, not fewer.

“Digital natives” aren’t thinking about containers anymore. Omni-channels.

Infuse the week with Church.

Millennials aren’t afraid of Jesus and Church and the Bible.

The implications of proxies: digital agents, bots, drones.

Online Gaming as social space. Youth pastors starting to think about this.

Outside groups tapping into tribal instinct, human need of belonging, shared experience.

[This is print vs. digital in the church space. Each approach has its affordances.]
