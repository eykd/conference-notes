Grew up w/ KJV. Dearly loves the KJV-only crowd. Most of Evangelicalism has given up on the KJV-only crowd, but he hasn’t.

Textus Receptus vs. modern Critical Texts, esp. conspiracy theories about Satanic nature of critical texts.

Inspired by Chesterton, Orthodoxy on conspiracy theories: it explains a large number of things, but not in a large way. 

How to “give air” to KJV-only crowd who are afraid of modern Critical Texts?

Almost nobody in KJV-only movement have real access to the facts of textual criticism, very little Greek and Hebrew knowledge, thus they lack the capacity to truly understand the problem.

KJV Parallel Bible aims to serve the need and demonstrate how inconsequential the differences between Textus Receptus and Critical Texts truly are.

Site dedicates one page to each chapter of NT. Two columns: on left, KJV (Textus Receptus). On the right, the Critical Text, how the KJV would look if the KJV translators had the NA28 available.

Several visual lessons from comparing the two texts:

The aim of the project was to highlight the *differences* between the texts. But what stands out are the similarities. 

English makes certain patterns and variance more obvious. Insufficient sampling is a common problem. KJV-only movement tends to cherry-pick its examples. But you can only cherry-pick if the audience doesn’t have access to the data. This project gives data access to the common reader.

Interesting: a lot of KJV-only professors are *not* KJV-only!

The TR reads smoother, and is often “helpful” by filling in elliptical language with more specific language. The Critical Texts don’t take away so much as the TR *adds*.

## How he did it!

Used Logos and BibleWorks. (BW has verse-by-verse comparison tool.) Did the comparison by hand, verse by verse, w/ volunteers. Manually adapted the KJV to account for critical textual differences. Manually to have editorial control. Used Markdown to mark differences.
