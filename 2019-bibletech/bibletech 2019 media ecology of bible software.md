# A Media Ecology of Bible Software

Mark Ward

Lots of people are thinking about these issues. Paratextual features, the effects of technology on reading and studying the Bible.

Half the time, the doomsday prophets are on to something.

The other half the time, media ecology is a way for old fogey to kvetch about kids these days.

Is there a middle way? 

Neil Postman: Technopoly

He’s got some even-handed statements.

“Every technology is both a burden and a blessing.”

Is tech taking away anything of value? Are we losing something we shouldn’t let go by replacing the codex w/ the smartphone?

Media ecology: Postman: “A new technology doesn’t add or subtract, it changes fundamentally.” Technological change is ecological.

Embedded in every tool is an ideological bias: to emphasize one thing over another.

We think we are using technology to equip the church. And we are.

“Every generation freaks out over the corruption of youth by new technologies.” Bob Pritchett

Ray Kurzweil vs. Ned Ludd

Turning away from Neil Postman, towards Andy Crouch, Alan Jacobs, John Dyer. Crouch is the best. “Culture-making” book.

Genesis 1:28, the cultural mandate: subdue the earth and have dominion over it.

Crouch asks 5 questions:

1. What does Bible software assume about the way the world is? 
  - Responding to Bible illiteracy and making sense of the mass of Biblical data
  - Software good at counting; tends to assume the need for tabulation.
  - Software needs to filter out information that doesn’t help. More information and organized information will always be at odds. 
  - Paradox of choice. Too much information overwhelms.
  - Human curation *always* necessary
2. What does software assume about the way the world should be? What vision of the future guides it? 
  - What sense does it amplify? Counting.
  - Can amplify bad Bible interpretation.
  - Bad argument undermines love: because Gk. agape for love occurs in imperative more often, phileo in (indicative?), so one is more important than another. This would never have occurred to Calvin, because his tools didn’t show him that.
  - Breathtakingly bad word study: skipping about from language to language, bad logic, enabled by Bible software.
  - Making pro tools accessible has made amateurs very dangerous!
  - 
3. What does software make possible? What can people do or imagine that they couldn’t before?
  - Finding verses you know exist but can’t find the reference
  - Checking multiple opinions
  - Amassing usage data carefully and beautifully
  - taking a library everywhere
  - not having to memorize herod’s family tree
4. Conversely, what does software make impossible or very difficult? What has become all but impossible?
  - don’t *need* to memorize herod’s family tree
  - knowledge lies even more outside our minds than before
  - lazy habits of mind reduce disciplined application of our minds to study
  - yet bible software has rescued his Hebrew ability, which otherwise would have atrophied
  - 
5. What new forms of culture are created in response to software? What is created that could not have before?
  - A new tradition of creativity to cultivate
  - We can create tools that are beloved by students of the Bible
  - Our culture is souring on Facebook and Google, etc.
  - We aren’t souring on Bible software
  - It’s up to us to show what powers are latent in God’s good creation
  - ref. Gabe Cooper’s talk on turning the screen
  
  
Postman, from “Technopoly”: those who resist technopoly are people who refuse to accept efficiency as the preeminent goal of life. People who do not accept calculation as a substitute for judgement.

2 principles:

1. We should be loving resistance fighters
2. We should recover the metanarrative provided by the Bible

Dangers:
- Distraction
- Paradox of choice

The most important thing to do is to pray for spirit-filled love and self-control. Temperance, restraint of sinful desire.

Metanarrative: Postman is in danger of blaming technology for the effects of secularism and scientism. Recovering the Metanarrative is crucial. No other story has the richness and value for explaining the world.

Wolters: “Creation Regained”

Crouch: “Culture-making”

Conclusion: other generations have also faced technological shifts. Don’t panic. God rules. Nothing people make is neutral. Perceive the burdens and blessings of new (and old) technology.

We must understand where our techniques come from, and what they are good for.

## Q&A

We have the tools we have. Make the best use of them. Build your knowledge of your tools.

With writing, we lost oral culture. This happens with each new technology. But we should always acknowledge the loss driven by technological progress.

Postman is pessimistic, Crouch is not, because of the cultural mandate in Genesis.
