What impact is technology having on biblical studies?

“The Bible and Digital Millennials”

Survey of millennials 18–35 and their Bible-reading habits.

Result: Millennials are indifferent to the Bible.

Writing a history of Bible software.

Technology contributes to the meaning of the text that it mediates.

[“The medium is the message”]

Digital computation is much less of an intuitive technology than the codex form.

How do we compare the differences? What questions can/should we ask?

Emphasizing reading, not oral methods.

## How it began

Triumphal entry passage in Luke 19:41.

“And as he entered he wept over Jerusalem”… and then the page ended, though the sentence continued on the next page. And a new meaning came across, emphasizing Jesus’ weeping. 

This is a property (pagination) of the codex format which would not have occurred in a papyrus scroll or a screen scroll. The technology imparted its own emphasis to the text.

“Paratext” is how a text is packaged. Tables of contents. Headings. Page numbers. Pagination. Layout. Book covers. Everything about how the text is presented to the reader.

In digital books, paratexts are navigational, UI features, etc. 

Every form that packages a text has its unique paratext.

The binding of a Bible, among other features, is a significant paratext in a printed Bible, suggesting that the 66 ancient texts belong together as a unified text. Also, unified typography, sequential page numbers across the volume.

In synagogues back in the day, the scriptures were scrolls in a barrel.

A printed Bible has a sense of finality and permanence. This has a theological impact on the Church’s interpretation of the text.

stepbible.org has lots of interesting paratextual features.

YouVersion’s Sign Up/Sign In is an interesting paratextual feature, encouraging Facebook/Google sign in over email. Lots of features in YouVersion encourage “community” engagement.

YouVersion Terms & Conditions disallows use to break the law. Interesting! Also, it emphasizes that it’s not your Bible, it’s YouVersion’s Bible. The sense in which you “own” a digital Bible is very different from how you own a physical Bible.

YouVersion tracks user data. How does that change?

YouVersion starts w/ John 1 in KJV, suggesting this is a suitable place to start.

Then YouVersion wants to send you notifications.

## Questions to ask

1. What are the significant paratexts of this Bible?
2. What meanings do they convey?
3. Which are familiar/unfamiliar to me?
4. Which do I consider positive? Neutral? Negative?
5. Which influence my reading the most/least?
6. How might I adjust the paratexts in order to improve my reading?

## What is the Bible?

Does our definition of ‘the bible’ depend on technology? No.

“A collection of ancient Jewish and Christian documents, written over 1,500 or so years, considered by the Church to be God’s inspired, written revelation to humanity.”

Hyperlinks? Navigational paratexts. Less intuitive than print navigation.

What are the most significant paratextual features? He’s not sure. In Scripture, the emphasis is on the written text. Written text has durability and permanence. How is that captured digitally? Also navigation very important.

How do you evaluate the nature and effect of paratexts? Is it subjective? Yes, because it gets into semiotics, meanings, perceptions, which are hard to quantify. Meaning-making is subjective.

Paratexts are Traditions!!!!
