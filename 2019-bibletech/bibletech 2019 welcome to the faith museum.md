# Welcome to the Faith Museum

Rev. Gary Carr

Museum <- Muse, collections of artifacts that invoke and connect to the muse.

Remembering seeing the ocean for the first time, almost a traumatic experience, same way of storing and recalling the memory.

Seeing a map of the ocean not the same as encountering the ocean itself.

The Bible is a map, a collection of documented experiences of God.

The map is not the journey, the map is not the territory. The map is a guide to the territory, the only way to move forward confidently. To cross the ocean to Japan, you need the collected wisdom of those who have crossed the ocean to Japan before, encoded in a map, to get there.

He’s a diver, has been in and under every ocean, collected flora and fauna from each. The ocean is far more than a body of water. The Faith experience is like that. The Bible is an artifact collected from the experiences of others.

When preparing digital experiences and artifacts, don’t forget the mental and emotional aspect of encountered faith, as encountered in the Bible.

How do we handle a Bible?

A print Bible experience is very different from a screen experience.

How do we handle our Bible differently now that it’s digital?

Can’t handle it manually, with hands. Stick a finger in to mark a section, switch to a different passage, then go back.

Important mental difference in handling something physically, manually, kinesthetically.

Difference in physical presence between interacting w/ print vs. interacting w/ digital media on a screen.

Yes, digital is effective in some ways, but it’s still in its infancy. We have a long ways to go. 

Features are distracting. 5 windows in Logos—how helpful are they?

“Digital natives” can switch tasks more effectively. Or can they? 

With all the distractions, are you paying close attention to what’s in front of you? Or are you distracted?

You have to stay on one thing for a long time to really understand it. Deep reading develops skills of reflection and consideration to produce insights.

Chapters and verses are an innovation that distracts from reading Philippians as a letter.

Efficiency vs. Effectiveness.

People don’t bring their bibles to church anymore. We lose that collective experience.

How is this changing the mission and practice of the Gideons?

How do we handle technology?

Audio Bibles are a reflection of the ancient practice of public reading of Scripture.

We have a Faith Tradition that precedes the Internet. There’s a lag time in the adoption of new technologies, in how they are absorbed into the Tradition.

Technology is “neutral” but truly it affords itself to certain usages. Are we deploying these affordances wisely?

Current screen technology is affording quick context switching.

Current technology affords easy data collection of viewing habits.

Nina Farrahan, prof. at Duke Law School, has video about “Whose data is it?”

How do we handle obsolescence of computer?

He misses Libronix 3.0. Kept it simple. But technology puts planned obsolescence on fast-forward.

Culture *values* vintage, but digital technology is difficult to preserve.

Do digital screens afford themselves to *lectio divina*?

Scripture Memory: Navigators and topical memory system. Physical cards.

Verse of the Day: a thimbleful of text.

We’re shaped morally by the tools we use.
