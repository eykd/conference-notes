# Tagging Meaning and Not Just Form

Mark Ward

Two questions:

1. What are the most fruitful ways we as bible software creators to tag scripture for meaning and not just form

2. What are the best ways to make this tagging useful and accessible for those who have been trained to search by form and not meaning.

Example: Herod who killed the babies in Jerusalem, and Herod who was eaten by worms. Are they the same? No, and Logos tagging can help you differentiate between them.

With multiple translations, searching for form can be fraught with peril.
