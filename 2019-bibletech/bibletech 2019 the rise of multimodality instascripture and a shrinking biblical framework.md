# The Rise of Multimodality: Instascripture and a shrinking Biblical framework

Jennifer Miles


## Overview

- Literacy rates
- Use of time
- Social semiotic theory (expansion on kinesthetic learning topic)
- The Social Media Gospel

## Literacy & Comprehension

Two sides of the same coin. 

Literacy: being able to read, comprehend, and synthesize information.

Literacy comes in different levels.

US adult literacy rates 

- Below basic: 14%
- Basic: 29%
- Intermediate: 44%
- Proficient: 13%

We’ve been relying primarily on personal Bible reading for understanding the Bible. But that only helps 1/2 people.

## Use of Time

American adults spend over 11 hours/day “interacting w/ media“.

American women spend 19 minutes per day reading, men 13 minutes/day.

The younger you are, the less you read.

“Post-literate” society: we *can* read, but we choose not to.

Media have become conversational. We need to become better at both consuming *and* producing.

## What is learning and how do we transfer knowledge?

Social semiotic theory: all of the means (resources, methods, actions, or systems) for making meaning.

Making meaning: creating a framework for means of learning.

Means of learning: 

1. Canonical recognized means
  - Formal education
  - Apprenticeships
  - Lectures
3. Societal/informal means
  
Modes: way or manner something occurs, is experienced expressed, or done.

- Aural
- Linguistic
- Textual
- Physical (gesture, body language)
- Spatial (layout, proximity; teacher stands at front, learners sit and face teacher)
- Visual (video, image, symbol)
- Combination

Every act of learning is a combination of modes.

Consider science textbooks: dense text, thick, complex diagrams, images. Modern textbooks have bullet points, color use, layout & chunking, headings, etc.

The more you chunk and preprocess, the more people will pay attention.

## Signs

Signifiers and signified.

Relationship between form and meaning not arbitrary
Sign always shaped by environment and place in env.
Each mode offers specific affordances
Modal signs differ significantly

Traditions have very specific signs. Cross vs. crucifix vs. east vs. west.

Historically, the gospel was told via visual images. Every surface is covered in signs.

## The Social Media Gospel

Lexham Survey of Theology

We tend to share “fortune cookies”: “encouraging words", not propositional statements. 

## What do do?

1. Participate actively in online conversations. Use images where appropriate, especially for memory aid. Use closed captioning for video (most video watched on mute)
2. Filter w/ 3 methods:
    - Is the signifier appropriate to meaning?
    - Does audience have shared experience necessary to understand meaning?
    - Do the things I share build a solid complete foundation?
4. Identify the foundation and start there. But don’t stop there.
