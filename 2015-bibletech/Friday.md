How to be a Christian technologist. Making relationships right using mobile technology.

## Is technology good?

John Adams: a good leader, a good dad. 

Spent the weekends writing constitutions, brewing beer, reading to kids. Traveled to France, wrote letters to his wife, daily. Three week delay.

Is technology good?

1. A balanced Gospel Story
2. Applying the story to tech
3. The story & Bible innovation

## Bad theology

- The singular idea: Jesus came to get me to heaven
- My purpose in building software: try to get people to heaven

Result: I loved building software, but it felt disconnected from my faith.

## The Gospel Story

Creation -> Fall -> Redemption -> Restoration

Most of time in church focused on Fall and Redemption. What about the rest of the story?

But God created the world, said it was good, created work, gave us creation, and told us to subdue it. All of it, before sin. He’s coming to reconcile all of it to himself.

## Good theology

- Singular idea: Jesus came to usher in his kingdom
- My purpose in building software: Jesus uses me to showcase how life works in his kingdom

Part of that is telling my coworkers about Jesus! Part of it is building amazing software!

## Cultural mandate

We are “co-creators”. God makes the raw materials and we refine what God has made in order to produce human flourishing. Andy Crouch, Culture Making, N.T. Wright, Surprised by Hope.

What we make as makers should reflect the restored life.

## A new set of questions?

How can I innovate using God’s raw materials and make life better?

What would the tech industry look like if things were as they should be?

What would interaction with God and others look like before the fall?

## 2 Key Principles

All software can show off the kingdom… not just “Christian” Software

As Christian technologists, we should seek to show off the kingdom in robust, multi-faceted ways.

## ShotZoom

If you think thoughts like “what would golf look like it heaven” it changes your view. Golfers love to play with each other. Build community around golfers at the golf course.

## Brushfire

Builds Bible apps. Put non-Christian developers on Bible apps. Put Christian developers on startups. 

## Alone together

Insulated consumption of content? Bowling alone. Reclusive behavior in public space. Technology allows us to:

- Hide from each other
- Avoid the hard work of relationships
- Expect more from tech and less from one another

## In-person interactions

Mobile amplifies relationships when people turn their screens around!

## The Pitch Point

The in-person spread of mobile. (Yelp!) Apps spread by people demonstrating them to each other.

Application: roll back the effects of broken relationships with Bible tech.

## The Social Bible

Design demo: sharing Scripture annotations socially

## The Coach’s Bible

Bible as Whiteboard. Tag drawings to verses.

## Book List

Creation Regained; Al Wolters
Culture-Making; Andy Crouch
Surprised by Hope; N.T. Wright

## Testing around in-person interactions

Make an hypothesis, then test it.



# Subsplash and the Church App

Christ Sharpe, Subsplash

This is an advertisement for their product. ;)

A platform for engaging and delighting their audience.

## Why mobile?

Lots of phones. People use them, over 120 minutes each day, over half of all digital media time spent.

## Why create an app?

Engage them where they are. Two most popular apps: news and games. 

## Three key tactics for audience engagement

- Availability. Is your content available? What is your game plan for the content you create? Ex: Making a sermon available beyond Sunday morning.

- Quality: Don’t just create it, make it great! Do you have people on your team that help you w/ design? Make a good first impression. Are there quality A/V components?

- Innovation: Constantly improve! Keep investing in the technology. Let technology work to help you and your goals.

## Subsplash Platform

An all-on-one integrated solution to present and manage your content across multiple channels.

## Benefits of the church app

- Expanded reach (more downloads of an app than members in the church?)
- Significant increase in online giving
- Savings through printing costs

- Audio and Video are key
- Sharing very important, how it’s shared and embedded (images, artwork, info, etc.)
- App builder

He’s making a big deal about gross downloads, download rates per month. Sounds like a vanity metric to me though.



# Tolle Lege! Designing Readable Bibles w/ Digital Typography

Chris Krycho, student at Southeastern Baptist Seminary, software developer http://holybible.com http://chriskrycho.com

Typography gives meaning to text. An essential element in making a text readable.

*Tolle Lege*! “Take up and read!”

A story: a young man wrestling w/ his faith. Heard a children’s song, “Tolle Lege!” Took up a Bible and read it. Conversion! His name is St. Augustine.

That he could take it up and read it matters. Readability matters.

Typography and typesetting are how we *display* a text for reading. Includes fonts, but also other things…

## Essential questions

1. Can you *read* individual words clearly?
2. Can your eye *flow* through a line easily?
3. Can your eye *flow* from line to line easily?
4. Does the form *match* the content? e.g. don’t set Bible text in Comic Sans. ;)

### Tools

- “Page” layout (flow): no such thing as a page; marginless spaces that we constrain in certain ways.
- Hierarchy and rhythm (flow): How do we demonstrate hierarchy between components of text? Is there vertical and horizontal rhythm?
- Typeface (read words; form matches content)

#### Layout: Pure bang for your buck

Layouts are at *least* as important as the font.

- Text size
- Line length
- Line height (leading)
- The *relationship* between these factors


#### Text size

Goals:

- Large enough to read! (Designers, stop licking your screen!)
- Small enough to read a *lot* (relatively speaking).
- Not too small, not too large; no hard and fast rules. Make it just right.

No hard and fast rule. Typeface matters!

#### Line length

Rules of thumb:

- 48-78 characters per line. 50-72; 45-68. In the ballpark.
- 10-12 words per line *minimum*.
- Avoid extremes
- These rules change per language, but western characters per line will stay roughly the same. Balance the length of the line vs. the size of the line.

No hard and fast rule. Typeface matters!

#### Line height

- Historically called “Leading”
- Rule of thumb: 1.5 x the size of the text (12pt text, 18pt line height). 1.4–1.6 works well. 
- Increase for wider lines
- Decrease for narrower lines

No hard and fast rule. Typeface matters!

#### Relationship

Typeface, line length, and line height inevitably interact.

Different typefaces require different relationships. Examples:
- Didot
- Century Gothic

## Hierarchy and Rhythm

Answer the question: what’s what?

- What’s a heading?
- What’s body text?
- What is something else entirely (e.g. chapter and verse numbers)?
- How do all the pieces relate to each other?

**Difference draws attention!** This can be good or bad. Use it wisely to support the readability of the text.

### Tools

- Weight, style, ornamentation
- Typeface
- White space and position

#### Weight, style, ornamentation

- **Bold**
- *Italic*
- Ornamentation:
  - Underline
  - Markers (daggers, pilcrows, sections, etc.)

#### Typeface

- Changing font inevitably draws attention
- Good ways to use this:
  - Distinguish headers from body text
  - Distinguish notes from Scripture

#### Whitespace

Horizontal and vertical space between elements indicate **relationships**, e.g. indentation, centering, alignment

(Use a scale!)

Article: Don’t Compose Without a Scale (A List Apart)

[Can’t find the ALA link, but found this: http://webtypography.net/3.1.1]

A scale defines your relationships between sizes of elements and spacing. Create a “scale” of proportional sizes to use for type size and vertical rhythm to create harmonious composition.

- 1.618 (golden ratio)
- modularscale.com

#### Color

Color can grab attention, but be careful. Not everyone can see the colors you can see. Can be a crutch. Rule of thumb: design it in grayscale. If it works in grayscale, it will work in color. Use color to pop, emphasize existing hierarchy.

- Make it work in grayscale
- Use color to emphasize existing hierarchy

#### Typeface

“Font” is specific size, weight, and style of a typeface. The most obvious aspect of typesetting. Choose typefaces wisely; good typefaces *delight* the reader.

Goals in choosing a typeface:

- Readability in context
- Suitability to text

##### Readability in context:

- Newspaper
- Smartphone
- Book
- Reference book
- Laptop

Each requires a different typeface!

##### Suitability to text:

- Resume
- Bible
- Soap advertisement
- Code

#### Types of faces

http://ilovetypography.com

Lots of variations within each major grouping!

- Sans vs. serif: no horns or horns
- Proportional vs. monospace: width of character
- Body, display, decorative: what context is it designed for? Use body face for large runs of text; display face for large, short-text displays; decorative: for wedding invitations
- Stroke: x-height (height of the x), width (width and consistency of stroke), style ; the physical characteristics of the strokes that make up the glyphs of the font


## Bible Typefaces

- Choose *readable* over *stylish*
- Match the typeface to the content: context includes *translation* (Don’t set the King James in Helvetica)
- Get the reader in the flow of the layout
- Use hierarchy and rhythm. Difference draws attention.
- Use a scale for whitespace
- Typefaces: know what distinguishes them. Use them suitably in context.

# Tag All the Things!

Peter Venables, Faithlife


Semantic tagging of textual features; linking those tags to study resources

Example: Woman, specific women by name, etc.

## What things?

- Named entities
- Mentioned in context, not isolated


## What makes tagging difficult?

Searching for names won’t work.

Open domain: we don’t know all the names

Ambiguity:
- Is this a name?
- Scope ambiguity
  - Smith, David
  - Smith, David, and Jones
  - He accused John of Heresy
  - He accused John of Damascus
- Capitalization and Punctuation are ambiguous

Ambiguity is a *feature* of language, not a bug. But it makes for hard problems when computers are involved.

Referential Ambiguity: Who is John? Who is Roman? What is Greek?

## How Named Entity Tagging Works

Two problems:
- Recognition
- Disambiguation

Part-of-Speech tagging

Scheme: IOB2 (Inside Outside Begin)

Sequence classification: take a sequence of items, apply a classifier to them using Supervised Learning; apply a machine learning algorithm to manually tagged samples.

## Feature extraction

Identifying features of words and word sequences.

- Word  case, digits, non-English, lemma, prefix, suffix, possessive, part of speech, length, punctuation, pattern
- Gazetter: stop words, dictionary, abbreviations, names, places
- Corpus features: term frequency, document frequency
- Previous word features
- Next word features

## Supervised Learning: Algorithms

Black boxes!

- N-Grams
- Regular expressions
- Brill Tagger
- Hidden Markov Machines
- …

## Named entity tagging services

- spotlight http://spotlight.dbpedia.org (free)
- aylien http://aylien.com
- alchemy http://alchemyapi.com

Solution: use all three, and if any two agree, accept the tag!

Value high precision over high recall. We want to trust the tags we find.

## What makes tagging difficult?

Cultural bias, ambiguity.

Existing taggers have pop culture bias! Jerusalem the city, or Jerusalem the band?

- “times” Newspaper!
- “Lord” House of Lords!
- “Samaria” Samaria, Indiana

Which “Mary”?
- Mary the mother of Jesus
- Mary Magdalene
- Mary, the mother of James
- Mary, the mother of Joses
- Mary, the wife of Clops
- Mary of Bethany
- …
- The “other” Mary

Have their own databases of people, places, things. Cross-linked with Wikipedia and Freebase. Limited manual checking, but so far only publish things linked to internal db.

Mountain of automatically classified tags, too much to manually check. Still working on process of accepting classifications. Perhaps using semantic data from public sources.

Started with Bible dictionaries. 40,000 books in the Logos database. He wants to tag them all! 

Logos uses crowdsource community tagging! Right click on any word, and tag it (or correct the tag).

## Future Work

- Curate:
  - Link more Logos data sets to Wikipedia
  - Overcome pop-culture bias
- Disambiguate
  - use context to distinguish referents

## Q&A

- What about pronouns? Let’s solve the name tagging problem first. :)


# Battling Biblical Blindness: Solving the Problem of Biblical Illiteracy

LaRosa Johnson; Technologist at Olive Tree

## What we know about Bible study

- It’s hard work, takes time; lots of weird details (who wrote the Gospel of John?)
- Bible readers become mature Christians
- Bible readers are active in their faith
- Discipleship doesn’t happen alone (can give them the software, but how do they make sense of it?)

## Defining the Problem

What does the data say?

Life way: 23% didn’t read a single book last year. Of Regular Church Attenders:
- 45% read the Bible more than 1x week
- 19% read the Bible daily
- 18% never read the Bible

American Bible Society: Amount of thought given to application:
- Weekly Bible Readers: 58% a lot, 35% some, 7% none
- Hear the Bible read aloud, but don’t read at home: 28% a lot, 50% some, 17% none

Main Message of the Bible:

- God is love 40% (overall + Protestants)
- Story of God & his desire to have relationship w/ his creation 31% overall (48% Protestants)

Millenials scored significantly lower in Bible knowledge (vs. self-assessment!)

Ligonier:

- Only 60% agree that Jesus is fully God/Man
- Only 63% believe God is perfect
- Only 18% agree the smallest sins deserves hell (51% of Evangelicals)
- 67% believe people are good by nature (44% of Evangelicals)

A lot of work to do teaching people about God and the Bible!

## Interpreting the Data

- People don’t read as much as they used to
- The unchurched know less about the Bible
- No big picture of the Bible
- God and sin are distorted

## Why doesn’t Bible software help?

What we do well?

- We make it available
- We make easy-to-use apps
- Bible study faster and more efficient
- Libraries become portable and more affordable vs. print

What don’t we do well?

- Price barrier ($10 too much!)
- We assume people will figure it out; but it’s not easy, discoverability suffers
- Engagement happens in a silo
- No one offers the “complete” package

## Solving the problem

- More quality *open* books/resources
- Make it easy to create and sustain community online
- Do a better job disciplining people in the Bible *and* technology. Now we need to teach them about the Bible *and* about how to use the software
- Digital Bible study campaign?

# 4 Revolutions: How Technology is Accelerating the Fulfillment of the Great Commission

Troy Carl, Vice President, Faith Comes by Hearing

50% of the world is illiterate. Faith Comes by Hearing works to get the Bible to oral cultures via audio recordings of native translations.

We face the twin barriers of poverty and illiteracy. But! God enables the hearing of his word by his Holy Spirit!

Where is technology going? Wayne Gretsky: skate to where the puck is. Ex: William Darby getting a job at Western Union.

## Fulfilling the Great Commission

Mt. 24:14: “And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world for a witness unto all *nations* [ethnos]; an then shall the end come.”

What is a nation? Gk. “ethnos”: language, tribe, tongue.

Mark 16:15 “And He said to them, “Go into all the *world* and preach the gospel to every creature.”

World: “kosmos”, *system*, a man-made system.

Go into every *system* and preach the Gospel. Judicial systems. School systems. Public, legal systems. Technological systems. Anything you can preach the Gospel in, go *there*, for every language, tribe, and tongue.

Digital Bible Platform.

## 4 Revolutions

- Mobile revolution
- Social revolution
- Connected revolution (Internet of Things)
- Data revolution (Big Data)

7.2 billion people. 52% urban, 48% rural. Urban residents are more easily reachable.

2.4 billion internet users, 35% internet penetration.

1.8 billion active social network users; 26% social networking penetration.

6.5 billion mobile subscribers; 93% mobile penetration.

Technology allows people to connect in ways we never dreamed possible.

1.9 billion mobile devices sold last year. Rise of supply chains as economic engines to move massive number of units.

## Digital Bible Platform

An Open Source System; API, audio, text, video, etc.

1,573 languages. 883 audio bibles. Bible.is

digitalbibleplatform.com, simple and clear API documentation

1,000+ languages in video, audio, text.

## AEROSPACE DIVISION!!!!!!11!1/11!!!!

This presentation is literally untranscribable. These guys have VISION.


# Ancient-Future Language

Michael Stevens
@mstevensrev

Isaiah 40:28: “Have you not known? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable.” (Juxtaposed w/ Google home page.)

Ray Ozzie: “The beauty of software is that if you can imagine it, you can build it.”

Noam Chomsky: “A language is not just words. It’s a culture, a tradition, a unification of a community, a whole history that creates what a community is. It’s all embodied in a language.”

## Theological underpinnings of language

- Tower of Babel - Gn 11.6-7
- The Logos - Jn 1.1
- Creation - Gn 1.2, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24 & 26
- Pentecost - Acts 2.4

## The Underwear Effect

Translating shampoo instruction? The closer you get to the customer’s personal lives, the more they expect to use their mother tongue.

## Localization

02/03/04: April 2, 2003, February 3 2004, etc.

International Commerce: Big money selling outside the US.

## Our culture keeps asking the question: What are we going to do when the machines come to kill us?

Or, what are we going to do when the machines don’t want to kill us, but want to LOVE us?

## At the end, people matter

C.S. Lewis quote from Weight of Glory: “There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal.”


# EPUB3

Olive Tree Bible Software

- Previously based on Palm tech (PDBs)
- Recently migrated to EPUB

Stock rendering technology (e.g. WebView) has recently improved quite a bit. EPUB has become a fairly universal format, based on XHTML.

Migrated entire catalog from PDB to EPUB.

## What is EPUB?

- Open and free ebook platform
- Reflowable text
- Inline images
- XHTML
- CSS
- XML

First file in the zip archive must be an uncompressed mime type file, containing the following text:

    application/epub+zip

Most readers don’t care about the mimetype, but validators do. YOU SHOULD USE A VALIDATOR.

Next, `container.xml` which describes the archive and names the OPF file, which is the roadmap to the EPUB archive.

Some readers may assume a certain conventional file structure.

content.opf contains:

- metadata
- manifest: a list of items contained in the archive
- spine
- guide


## Two things to remember:

1. Content *will* be re-flowed
2. Your CSS may *not* have precedence

## Simple improvements

- Simplify layout w/ reflow ability in mind
- Use ems and percents
- Don’t use points and pixels
- Keep e-ink displays and smaller screens in mind


# Paper or Pixels?

Sean Harrison, Black Earth Group

(The answer is yes, of course.)

## The surprising health of print in (what we thought was) the digital age

NLT sold more print bibles in 2014 than in 2013. Not taking market share away from anyone else.

Digital Bible Publishing is stagnant! The novelty of digital has worn off. People are judging products by value. Sales have leveled off.

We’ve run up the limits of repurposing content. 

## The Illustrated Study Bible

4-color study bible, only recently possible.

NLT Study Bible released print and digital at the same time. NLT Illustrated Study Bible is print only.

Digital bible dev is not a magic bullet, and cannot be an afterthought. Instead, develop print-native editions, and digital-native editions. The form defines the art.

We must understand the strengths and weaknesses of each platform and learn to capitalize on the strengths of each while avoiding the weaknesses.

We need to understand preferred usage patterns and develop patterns that enhance these patterns. Ex: Apple Watch integrates 


## Strengths of Print

Print has stability and permanence, simplicity and physicality, and it provides context with immediacy.

The print page is *fixed*. This is important to people.

We now design for spreads. A spread contains more information than a screen can. Visually immersive and complete.

## Strengths of Digital

Searchability!

Shareable! Post to Facebook and Twitter!

Portable! Customizable! Choice! Rich Semantic Data.

Less used strengths: Non-linear, media-integrated, dynamic content. These can be used more if we focus on digital-native product development.

### Question: Are there things that we haven’t done, or done enough of, that would make sense in digital?

1. Highly visual, highly designed digital-native products.

We need a product development pipeline that bypasses print production.

We need an app platform that is smart, deeply designed, and aesthetically and functionally pleasing ways.

2. Better semantic search.

Google does a better job of this than we do. :)

Of course, this problem is really hard, and Google has the best engineers working on it.

3. Subscriptions

## Integrating Print and Digital

Developing an approach that plays to the strengths of each medium. Find the usage patterns for the Bible and enhance them w/ integrated print-and-digital products.

Make things that integrate a computer and the physical world.

Ex: Word Lens app: automatic translation of print text

Develop a digital-native ecosystem for the development and immediate publishing of new Bible content.

Bible Software and Bible publishing need to join together more closely.
