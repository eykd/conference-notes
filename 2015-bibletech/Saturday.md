# How the Digital Library Metaphor Breaks Down

<email redacted>

Premises

1. 

Ways to read

1. Devotional
2. Educational: Seeking something new
3. Therapeutic: Comfort and Consolation
4. Appropriatively: Life Application

Approaches to physical books:

Annotators: “Carnal lovers”

Bibliophiles: “Courtly lovers”

Annotators more prominent throughout history

- Glossa Ordinaria (1498): First “Study Bible”
- Great Bible (w/ manicures) (c.1540)
- Geneva Bible: Most important footnote in the history of the world: Exodus 1:17, 19 (“Their disobedience herein was lawful, but their dissembling evil”)

Study aids printed in early modern Bibles

- Advice on how to study the Bible
- Summaries
- Headers
- Marginal notes/cross-references
- Maps & diagrams

Philip Doddridge: Family Expositor (1739-1756), three translations, application notes, “critical” notes, pithy paraphrase & expanded translation. (Stephen wants to see this in digital form!)

Two types of book annotations:

- Telegraphic: 
- Explicit

Two locations:

- within text
- marginal (or blank space)

Desirable properties of digital annotations

1. in-place
2. non-interpretive
3. fluidity
4. informal codings (internally consistent personal code)
5. smooth transitions public/private
6. integration w/ reading as activity, few distractions
7. multiple workspaces (people arrange them how they want to arrange them)
8. memory (where did I leave off?)

“To imagine continuous reading as the norm is radically reactionary; it is to read a codex as if it was a scroll, from beginning to end.” — Peter Stallybrass

Continuous reading is not the norm, historically

Hillesund, “Digital Reading Spaces”: Contiuity in text, continuity in time.

81% most people most of the time spend their time reading continuously in text and time

Discontinuity in time implies discontinuity in text.

Personal notes are less popular than highlights and favorites. Writing a note, cognitively or functionally, note taking is hard.

Interesting: they took public notes and analyzed them for content and style;


1. You -> Text
Most popular notes: Note-taker interrogating the text: ? and ???

Is there a way we can “show up” when someone has a question and offer to help answer questions?

2. …

3. Text -> You

4. Others -> You (Sermon notes)

Sermon notes, application-focused. Numbered points.

5. Text -> Text

Mostly references, occasionally passage text, keywords, parallel passage

6. You -> God

Prayer: Inward, Outward, Upward

7. You -> You

Mark / Date / Purpose / Unrelated

8. Text -> God

Doctrine, similar to application

9. Others -> Text

Quotes, history

## Digital + print integration

Digital libraries don’t necessarily reflect how people use the print Bible.

Creative ways to integrate the Bible w/ physical world?

E-ink; 

Conductive ink; touch Bible 

Augmented reality Bible study: holograms in the field of vision

Augmented reality bookshelf

## Imaginative uses

Digital Bible Library metaphor breaks down.

Bible journaling: search on Pinterest! This can’t be done in a digital Bible!

80 Days shout-out! CYOA Catechism!!!!!!!!!!!

Explorable explanations (Brett Victor!!!): Interactive text that reflects changes you make

Exploring a systematic theology: how important is a doctrine to your systematic theology? How does removing a doctrine or assumption affect the model?

Popular emoji in public Bible notes?

Philip Melanchthon’s (reformer) marginal doodles (1497-1560) book on Internet Archive

Emojipocalypse: 2028

## Ideas

An iPad app that lets you doodle in the margins?



# Is a Radical Shift Coming to Bible Engagement?

Kent Schaeffer, www.OpenChurch.com

Travelled around the country to interview Christian leaders, find out what everybody is doing, where the direction of ministry is going, how to spur collaboration.

What if the Kingdom was a place where access to Scripture was only limited by one’s hunger for God?

In conversations, Scripture engagement continually pops up. Scripture is the most valuable resource we have to give to people in the kingdom.

An inconvenient truth: some translations are restricted. The Scripture engagement industry is divisive, polarized, and politicized. Driven by good intentions and strong convictions.

But how can we collaborate better? Without compromising our convictions?

Looking back at history: why does scripture engagement work the way it does now? What do we gain in shifting? What do we lose in shifting? (E.g. the shift from oral to written culture.)

1800s: Age of Steam, Industrial Revolution, exciting times. Scripture engagement organizations arose: raise some money, go to a printer, print some Bibles, then distribute them as freely as possible. But it wasn’t scaling. Leaders began asking, what if we could take the Bible to *anybody* who has need? Lots of innovations. Philadelphia Bible Society invested in stereotype plate technology for extremely cheap printing; American Bible Society established in 1816, collaborated with existing groups in New York City.

Pioneering organizations encounter all the initial problems: good intentions encountering pitfalls, learning and adjusting. Early ABS history reflects this. By 1819, 1821, it became expensive to maintain the stereotype plates. Local hubs encouraged to sell Bibles to wealthy who could afford them. Problems arose: some groups began *only* selling Bibles, ABS had to correct them.

Protestantism closely allied w/ Capitalism during this era. Printing books doesn’t come cheap, esp. when trying to reach the entire nation. But retail sales undermined the founding mission of free distribution of the Gospel to all, high and low, rich and poor. Retail sales produced rich auxiliaries subject to market forces. ABS innovated a second time by centralizing control and production, w/ local distribution.

We’re facing these problems again: free distribution of the Gospel, countered by market forces wanting to channel the benefit to the rich.

Keepers of the sacred text are restrictive because they take seriously their need to responsibly use the text. Logistical dynamics imply restrictions and royalties.

Print has its costs. It makes sense! Marginal costs go down considerably with digital distribution models.

Churches are able to be freer with this, because they have a safety net of congregational contribution. Parachurch organizations, not so much, are reliant on royalty streams. The temptation is to latch on to those streams. Yet we don’t need stereotype plates any more.

Cultural shift happens through gain, pain, or an act of God. The opportunity of profit helps. The fear of loss helps too!

Groups (like Every Tribe, Every Nation) are working behind the scenes, offering money to encourage collaboration (“political jockeying”) between entrenched organizations.

Digital Bible Platform has done a great job of navigating this landscape, but still restrained by legal problems. 

Tim Jory (Wycliffe Translator): Should everything be Creative Commons ShareAlike? :) Is this intellectual property? Isn’t this Holy Spirit-inspired? Does the 19th Century IP environment still make sense, esp. in the face of missions work in the field?

Wycliffe Associates is looking at new technology to translate scripture into new languages at record-breaking paces. Could all 6800 languages be under an open source license? 2-5 years to complete? In 10 years, free access to all translations?

What happens if our beloved translations protected by steep royalties are leapfrogged by open source translations? Pain may finally force the industry leaders to change.

Francis Chan now self-publishing.

Christianity infamous for reinventing the wheel, and doing it shoddily too. It’s not so much a technological challenge, but a political and relational challenge. Instead of each org. caring about X, but doing X, Y and Z as well, we need to collaborate w/ our specialties.

Interesting approach: Scriptive platform — https://www.scriptive.org/

The ideal way we recommend scripture is through relational, interpersonal sharing. How do we digitize this?

Value drivers in the Kingdom, equipping others, spreading the Gospel, can drive us to innovate and collaborate, despite market forces and business concerns.

Close: Abide in God, follow him, be sensitive to the Holy Spirit. Psalm 119:37—…


# Seeing the Big Picture: Visualizing Bible Data

## Seeing the Big Picture:

Visualization for art -vs- understanding

“Instead we set our sights on the other end of the spectrum—something more beautiful than functional.” — Chris Harrison

It’s pretty, but is there any insight?

- Can visualization amplify our cognition and show us things we couldn’t see otherwise?
- What kind of information?
- Visualization as storytelling — infographics, data w/ a point

## Understanding the Big Picture

One size doesn’t fit all!

## Kinds and Layers of Bible Data at Faithlife

- Language and Linguistics
- Aligned translations
- Bible text: words, lemmas, morph
- Senses, syntax, discourse, pericopes
- Case frames, prop. labels, genre, culture

Biblical knowledge, concepts, reference content, historical knowledge, cross-references.

Lots and lots of kinds and layers of data that Logos has developed over the years.

## The Process

Curate data, display, search, visualize, repeat.

How do we visualize larger units of text using this data?

Holy Week Timeline from BibleGateway.com (2011). https://www.biblegateway.com/blog/2015/03/bible-gateway-holy-week-infographic-published-in-newsweek/

![Holy Week Timeline](http://bg3-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/holy-week-timeline2.png)

### Logos 6 has Narrative Character maps.

- Relationships over time
- Curated art
- Interactive

### Logos 6 Psalms Explorer

Shneiderman’s mantra:

- Overview first
- Zoom and filter
- Details on demand

Of course, you have to organize the data first before you can visualize it.

### People and Places in Narrative

Enabling data

- Bible Knowledgeable
- Referent mentions (names, pronouns, descriptions)
- Pericopes

Big picture: how are mentions distributed throughout the text?

Demos of Logos, visualizations in D3.js

…

### Pericope

Counting things isn’t helpful.

#### Weight by Distribution

Standard approach: tf.idf

- tf = term frequency in a given doc
- idf = inverse document frequency: distribution of term across all documents

## Generalizing the approach

Visualize transitions between smaller and larger concepts.

## Conclusion

“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” — John Tukey

Not just piling up data, but helping data to be understood.

# Better Greek Learning through Better Greek Databases

James Tauber

Endless Cycle:

Linguistic Databases -> Enable -> Learning Tools -> Motivate -> Repeat

## Greek vocabulary flash cards

Needs a word list (presumably ordered) w/ glosses. You need data to drive the tool, and the data has to come from somewhere.

But we hit a problem: the “how to draw an owl” problem:

1. Draw some circles
2. Draw the rest of the owl!

## Graded readers

Text w/ words footnoted that appear fewer than X times.

Still a multi-year effort to produce the underlying databases, but once you have the database, it’s adaptable.

## Generating a Greek Reader

James wrote a reader generation script in Python! https://github.com/jtauber/greek-reader

- electronic text (SBLGNT)
- lemmatization (MorphGNT)
- Parse codes (MorphGNT)
- glosses (Dodson)

Books become “UI” derived *from* databases! A view of the database. Using these, we can produce more *adaptive* learning tools.

## A New Kind of Graded Reader

The traditional approach:

- vocabulary driven by paradigm being learnt
- vocabulary not shown in context
- hard to show much real text early on

The myth of vocabulary coverage:

- the 10 most common words account for 37% of the text
- the 100 most common words account for 66% of the text

This doesn’t help with understanding the semantic coverage!

If you learn the 100 most common words, you’ll..

- know at least one word in 99.9% of verses
- know at least 50% of the words in 91.3% of verses
- know at least 95% of words in 0.6% of verses


100 most common *forms* give you 0 verses!

Instead…

- introduce fully inflected forms in context
- Order the introduction of forms to maximize early access to text

2010 talk on this subject: http://graded-reader.org/

Learn 16 forms, learn 12 whole verses!

Caveats and limitations in earlier talk:

Didn’t consider:

- inflectional morphology
- syntax
- idioms
- derivational morphology / cognates
- how easy it is to guess a word

Why weren’t they considered? **They weren’t in the database!**

The data should support the pedagogical possibilities.

## Do you focus on lemmas or forms?

A false dichotomy, of course. Not just lemmas or forms, but lemmas, forms, stems, everything. Use the data to guide the approach. Morphology Networks.

If you know the rules that lead to an inflected from, learning tools can be more adaptive to what a student has or hasn’t seen or what they are struggling with.

## Is it in the database?

Morphological Lexicon of New Testament Greek

- stems
- relationships between stems
- principal parts
- endings
- preverbs
- augmentation
- morphophonological rules

Didn’t consider?

- inflectional morphology — **Done!**
- syntax
- idioms
- derivational morphology / cognates — **Coming soon!**
- how easy it is to guess a word

## Other Benefits

- validating MorphGNT analysis
- executable grammars (unittests for grammars?!)
- expanding to other texts (Septuagint, Epictetus, etc.)

## Learning Tools

Build an open source extensible framework for building learning activities from a database.
